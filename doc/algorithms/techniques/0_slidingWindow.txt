Overview
-The Sliding Window problem type is any problem that analyzes a small portion of a larger data set and shifts the edges of 
 the window to the left or right to find the final solution to the problem.
-This document describes the conditions which must be met for a problem to be considered a Sliding Window problem; as well as,
 how to solve the Sliding Window problem

Conditions
-For a problem to be considered a Sliding Window problem, at least two out of the next three conditions must be satisfied
    1. The input of the problem must be either an Array, String or something similar
    2. The problem involves find a Subsequence or a Substring within the input data
    3. We have a given Window Size (k), or we have to find the Window Size

Types of Sliding Window Problems
-There are two types of Sliding Window Problems
    1. Fixed Size Window
        -k is given by the problem
    2. Variable Size Window
        -k is not given by the problem

Variable Size Sliding Window Template
-The following template can be used in any Variable Size Sliding Window problem

function()
{
    while (j < size)
    {
        // Calculation happen's here

        if (condition < k)
        {
            j++;
        }
        else if (condition == k)
        {
            // ans <-- Calculation
            j++;
        }
        else
        {
            while (condition > k)
            {
                // remove calculation for i
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }
    }

    return ans;
}
