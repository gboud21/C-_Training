Kernel
-A computer program at the core of a computer's operating system that maintains control of the system.
-The kernel is always in memory
-When an application interacts with the kernel it does so by invoking a system call

Responsibilities
-Handles all of startup except for starting itself (that is the bootloader's job)
-Prevents and mitigate conflicts between processes, handles interrupts
-Manages hardware resources (ie Memory, IO)
    -Random-acess Memory (RAM)
    -Input/Output (IO) devices
    -Resource Management
        -Protection mechanisms for mediating resources between processes
        -Synchronoization and Inter-Process Communication(IPC)
            -Context Switching
    -Memory Management
        -Virtual Addressing
            -Provides a layer of indirection by managing data that is not currently in memory to free up resources
                -Typically done through paging
    -Device Management
        -Provides access to peripherals
-Facilitiates interactions between hardware and software components
