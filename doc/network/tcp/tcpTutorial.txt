The Client Server Model
-The Client Server Model is an architectural pattern that details how two processes communicate with each other. This pattern can be 
 summarized as having one or more "client" processes that connect to and make requests of a single "server" process which is responsible
 for processing those requests and providing data back to the requesting client. For more information on this pattern see:
 doc/softwareArchitecture/projectStructure/clientServer.txt

Connection Procedure
-TCP, Transmission Control Protocol, is a standard that defines reliable, in order, and error-checked network communication stream of octets/bytes
 between two devices.
    -Reliable
        -The delivery of a data packet is acknowledge by the sender. Essentially what happens is that when a packet is transmitted by a device using
         TCP, upon receiving the packet, the receiver of the data packet sends a message back to the sender to inform them of the packet that was
         received.
    -In order
        -Each packet is numbered and guaranteed to be processed by the network stack in the order it was sent. If a packet is received out of order
         then the receiver will send a message back to the sender informing them that the packet was received out of order and requesting the sender
         to resend the next packet.
    -Error-checked  
        -A partial hash/checksum/CRC is calculated by the sender of some of the fields within the TCP Packet. When the receiver receives a new packet,
         they recalculate the hash on the same fields and then compare it to the value stored within the TCP Packet. If the two values are the same then
         the packet is considered "intact" and is error free. If the two values are not equal then there has been some corruption during transmission
         and the receiver will respond to the sender to request a new copy of the packet be sent.
-TCP is "connection-oriented". This means that prior to transmitting any data between the two devices a connection must be requested and a handshake 
 between the devices must occur to establish the network communication.
    -The TCP connection is established using the following procedure:
        1. The server is running and listening for connection requests from potential clients.
        2. The client requests a connection from the server using the server's IP Address and specifies its own IP Address so that the server knows 
           how to communicate back to the client. The segment in this request is a packet containing SYN (Synchronize Sequence Number). 
        3. The server responds to the client's request with SYN-ACK, which is an acknowledgement packet that informs the client that the server has
           received the SYN request and also specifies what sequence number it will start the segment with.
        4. The client acknowledges the SYN-ACK by sending an ACK. At this point both the client and server establish a reliable connection to transfer data.
