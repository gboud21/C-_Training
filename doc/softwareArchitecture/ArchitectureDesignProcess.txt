Description:
This document provides a general process for architecting a software application. There are multiple sections 
whose scope range from planning/designing the high-level structural aspects of the application all the way
down to designing individual software components.

Structural Design:
1) Review Requirements/Use Cases/Procesdures
    a) Document required functionality of the application
    b) Document any timing constraints that could drive changes to threading architecture
2) Review External Interfaces
    a) Document design constraints applied by the external systems. For example (network connections, external timing, data formats, etc)
3) Review any existing designs/code
    a) Document the purposes of each class and identify any areas of improvement/complexity which could be reduced 
4) Review Existing Applications
    a) Research applications that do similar things to try to find examples/ideas of both proven and ineffective applications to gain
       lessons learned prior to design.
5) Review Architecture Patterns
    a) Identify any patterns that could be applied or are known solutions to the problems solved by this application
6) Design
    a) Go forth and design the application using all of the knowledge gained.
