Overview
-This along with the files detailed below provide a centralized location for understanding and creating a 
 Software Requirements Specification (SRS).

Purpose of an SRS
-A SRS is a document which describes the functionality of the Computer Software Configuration Item (CSCI),
 or the application that is required for the application to function as required by the stakeholders needs;
 as well as, the expected performance criteria that must be met by the CSCI. While this document should 
 always be clear and concise, it is important to note that this document is not intended to include the details
 on design decisions for the software, for example architectural patterns or class details. What the SRS should
 provide are the criteria that will be tested against to validate the CSCI.
